# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, are committed to ensuring that participation in our community is a positive and respectful experience for everyone, regardless of their age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our goal is to create an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community where everyone feels valued and respected.

## Expectations for Behavior
To maintain a positive community environment, we expect all members, contributors, and leaders to adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Empathy and Kindness**: Treat others with empathy and kindness. Show understanding and consideration towards fellow community members.

* **Respect for Diverse Perspectives**: Be respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences. Acknowledge that diversity of thought enriches our community.

* **Constructive Feedback**: Constructively give feedback and be open to receiving it. Take responsibility for your actions and apologize when necessary, using the experience as an opportunity to learn.

* **Community-Centered Focus**: Prioritize the well-being of the entire community, not just individual interests. Strive for what benefits the community as a whole.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated within our community:

* **Sexualized Language or Imagery**: Avoid using sexualized language or imagery and refrain from making sexual advances.

* **Trolling and Insults**: Do not engage in trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, or personal or political attacks.

* **Harassment**: Harassment, whether public or private, is not acceptable. Respect personal boundaries and avoid intrusive behavior.

* **Sharing Private Information**: Do not publish others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit permission.

* **Inappropriate Conduct**: Refrain from any conduct that could be considered unprofessional in a professional setting.

## Responsibilities for Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for upholding and enforcing these standards of behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you encounter abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via email. All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.

Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
